\title{Calculating Area under Curve across multiple conditions and subjects}
\usage{
sm_auc_all(data, subjects, groups, conditions, x, values)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Name of the variable that stores the data frame that contains
the columns with the specified column names.}

\item{subjects}{The name of the column of the data frame that contains subjects.
It must be strings.}

\item{groups}{The name of the column of the data frame that contains each group.
It must be strings.}

\item{conditions}{The name of the column of the data frame that contains each condition.
It must be strings.}

\item{x}{The name of the column of the data frame that contains the
x-axis points/x coordinates from which the AUC can be calculated.
It must be strings. The column must not have
characters.}

\item{values}{The name of the column of the data frame that contains the
actual data, which are the y-axis points from which the
AUC can be calculated. It must be strings.}
}
\description{
This function returns a data frame containing AUCs from a data frame
that contains the original raw data. One of the two arguments 'groups'
and 'conditions' must be filled. The function will throw an error
if both arguments are empty.

\dontrun{
set.seed(1) # generate random data
day1 = rnorm(16,0,1)

Condition <- rep('Control', length(day1)*2)
df <- cbind(Subject, Value, Condition, Day)
