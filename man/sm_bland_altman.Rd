\title{A Bland Altman plot}
\usage{
sm_bland_altman(first, second, point_size = 3.3, diff_ci = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{first}{Data from the first repetition/session}

\item{second}{Data from the second repetition/session}

\item{point_size}{The size of the individual points. The default is set to 3.3.}

\item{diff_ci}{If set TRUE, then it will draw a shaded region that represents the 95%
confidence interval of the difference between the two sessions from one-sample t-test.
If the region (i.e. confidence interval) overlaps with zero, then there
is no significant bias/difference between the two sessions/datasets.
If it does not overlap with 0, then the measurement variability is significantly large.}

\item{...}{Parameters of geom_point(), such as 'color', 'fill', 'shape', etc.}
}
\description{
This function generates a Bland-Altman plot. This function
requires two paired data sets as input (same length), and uses sm_statBlandAlt()
to compute statistical values necessary for a Bland Altman plot. For more
information on these values, please type ?sm_statBlandAlt.

The plot automatically uses sm_classic() theme.
The upper dashed line indicates the upper limit (mean_diff + 1.96*sd), the middle
dashed line indicates the mean difference between the
two samples, and the lower dashed line indicates the lower limit
(mean_diff - 1.96*sd).

To add a legend, you will need to add sm_classic(legends = TRUE).
To customise the figure, you can add more geom objects.
