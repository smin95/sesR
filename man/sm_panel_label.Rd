\title{Writing a label for each panel of a combined figure}
\usage{
sm_panel_label(
  all_plots,
  x,
  y,
  panel_tag = "1",
  panel_pretag,
  panel_posttag,
  text_size = 4.5,
  text_color = "black",
  fontface = "plain",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{all_plots}{all_plots should be list, which should contain all panels
that are to be combined into one figure.}

\item{x}{Location of the label along the x-axis (0 to 1). 0.5 is the middle origin.}

\item{y}{Location of the label along the y-axis (0 to 1). 0.5 is the middle origin.}

\item{panel_tag}{A character vector that defines how each panel is enumerated. Options include:
'a', 'A', '1', 'I' or 'i'.'a' is for lowercase letters. 'A' is for uppercase letters. '1'
is for integers. 'I' is for upper case roman numerals. 'i' is for lower case roman numerals.
Each panel will display a unique string based on the set enumeration.}

\item{panel_pretag}{A character vector that is identical across panels BEFORE the panel_tag.}

\item{panel_posttag}{A character vector that is identical across panels AFTER the panel_tag.}

\item{text_size}{Text size of the panel label}

\item{text_color}{Text color of the panel label}

\item{fontface}{Fontface of the panel label. Options include "plain", "bold", "italic" and others
that are provided by ggplot2.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters for adjusting the appearance of the sticker. Same parameters
for annotate() from ggplot2.}
}
\value{
It returns a list of plots with panel labels.
