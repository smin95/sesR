\arguments{
\item{...}{A generic aesthetic parameter across points, boxplot and violin. This
is optional.}

\item{boxplot.params}{List of parameters for boxplot, such as color, alpha, fill etc}

\item{violin.params}{List of parameters for violin, such as color, alpha, fill etc}

\item{point.params}{List of parameters for individual points, such as color, alpha, fill etc}

\item{which_side}{String argument to specify the side of the boxplots and violinplots.
The options are: 'right' and 'left'. 'mixed' has been removed from smplot due
to its lack of usage.}

\item{sep_level}{A numerical value that controls the level of the separation among
the boxplot, violin plot and the points. The value can be 0-4.
If it's 0, all of these are clustered together. If it's 3, they are all
separated. 1 and 2 are somewhere in the middle. Default is set to 2.}

\item{point_jitter_width}{A numerical value that determines the degree of the jitter for each point. If its 0,
all the points will have no jitter (aligned along the y-axis).}

\item{vertical}{The orientation of the plots. The default is set to TRUE.
If you want the horizontal orientation of the plot, set this argument
as FALSE.}

\item{points}{If the points need to be displayed, the input should be TRUE.
If the points are not needed, the input should be FALSE.}

\item{borders}{If the border needs to be displayed, the input should be TRUE.
If the border is not needed, the input should be FALSE.}

\item{legends}{If the legend needs to be displayed, the input should be TRUE.
If the legend is not needed, the input should be FALSE.}

\value{
Returns a raincloud plot generated using ggplot2.

\description{
This function visualizes a raincloud plot, which is a combination of jittered points, boxplots
and violin plots. The creation of this function
has been inspired by the R package called 'raincloudplots' by Jordy van
Langen.

This function has been created to allow more customisation than the functions
in the raincloudplots package. Also, this function automatically sorts the data given the
condition that the x-axis factor levels have been sorted properly.
