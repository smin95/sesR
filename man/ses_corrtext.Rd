\usage{
ses_corrtext(
  x,
  y,
  text_x,
  text_y,
  data = data,
  method = "pearson",
  p = TRUE,
  r = TRUE,
  text_color = "black",
  font = "",
  size = 4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data set of the x-axis in the correlation plot.
If the argument 'data' is filled, then x can be the column name.
Otherwise, it has to take a form of numerical vector.}

\item{y}{Data set of the y-axis in the correlation plot.
If the argument 'data' is filled, then y can be the column name.
Otherwise, it has to take a form of numerical vector.
x and y must have the same length.}

\item{text_x}{Location of the text in the x-axis of the plot.}

\item{text_y}{Location of the text in the y-axis of the plot.}

\item{data}{Dataframe that contains x and y. This argument is optional.}

\item{method}{Method of computing the correlation coefficient: 'pearson', 'kendall',
or 'spearman'.
'Pearson' is often used for normally distributed data.
'Spearman' is often used for computing the strength of a non-linear correlation.}

\item{p}{Logical input is required ('TRUE' for displaying the p-value, '
FALSE' for not displaying the p-value).
p-value is used for determining statistical significance in the
hypothesis test. It depends on the sample size.}

\item{r}{Logical input is required ('TRUE' for displaying the r-value, '
FALSE' for not displaying the r-value).
r-value is the correlation coefficient. It does not depend on}

\item{text_color}{Color of the text in character string (ex. 'black').}

\item{font}{Font of the text in character string.}

\item{size}{Font size of the text}
