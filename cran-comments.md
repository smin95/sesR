## version 0.2.0
Dear CRAN team,

The reason for the quick update is that I have found some key bug in the primary function `sm_put_together()`, and I am working in a country where my students have trouble downloading repositories from Github due to firewall. I have read the CRAN policies, and I am certain that I won't need to update the package in the new few months. 
Thank you for your service.

Best regards,
Sam
