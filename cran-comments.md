* This is a new release.

## Resubmission (Round 2)
This is the 2nd resubmission. In this version:

* I have used the Authors@R field in DESCRIPTION.
* I have included a reference in the appropriate format within DESCRIPTION.
* Details have been added in the Description field.
* Title has been modified.
* TRUE and FALSE are used instead of T and F (ex. sm_boxplot()).
* \value added to the functions.
* \dontrun{} -> \donttest{} in all functions.
* Now, messages are removed in sm_auc_all() and sm_slope_all().
* I have removed seed settings within functions to specific numbers.
