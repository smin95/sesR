# sesR

**sesR** is a R package for statistical data visualization that complements ggplot2. It officially stands for **'super, easy, simple R'**. This package represents what I wish I had back when I was beginning to learn R. It aims to make every process of data visualization easy.

**sesR** was first created on May 2021, and it will be continuously updated.

### Installation

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
