# smplot

Author: Seung Hyun Min

**smplot** (SM: **S**eung Hyun **M**in) is an R package for statistical data visualization that complements ggplot2. This package represents what I wish I had back when I was beginning to learn R. It aims to make every step of data visualization easy.

**smplot** was first created on May 2021, and it will be continuously updated.

### Installation using RStudio

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('smin95/smplot')
```
