**smplot2** (SM: **S**eung Hyun **M**in) is an R package for statistical data visualization that complements ggplot2. This package represents what I wish I had back when I was beginning to learn R. It aims to make every step of data visualization easy.

**smplot** was first created in May 2021, and due to the numerous deprecated and newly created primary functions, **smplot** has now evolved into **smplot2**.

Key functionalities include shortcuts for plotting elegant figures that are appropriate for scientific journals and functions that facilitate generating and annotating composite figures.

### Installation using RStudio

You can install the released version of *smplot2* from CRAN.

```r
install.packages('smplot2')
```

The development version can be directly downloaded here:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('smin95/smplot2')
```
